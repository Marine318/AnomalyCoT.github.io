    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)shortened lead(B)deformed case(C)misaligned(D)tilted lead(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "shortened lead",
      "B": "deformed case",
      "C": "misaligned",
      "D": "tilted lead",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Likely cause: careful insertion of the component into the breadboard without applying excessive force or improper handling. The image shows a transistor properly mounted on a breadboard with leads inserted into the correct holes aligned straight and not shortened deformed or misaligned. The answer is (E) The defect type is no defect.",
    "Answer": "(E)no defect"
