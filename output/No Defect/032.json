    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)foreign_body(B)scratch(C)no defect(D)crack(E)broken.",
    "options": {
      "A": "foreign_body",
      "B": "scratch",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "crack",
      "E": "broken"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:For option (A), there is no foreign body present as the surface is clean and free of any extraneous objects. Likely cause: meticulous maintenance and installation. For option (B), there are no scratches visible; the surface appears smooth without any linear marks or blemishes. Likely cause: high-quality material and careful handling. For option (D), there are no cracks observed; all panels maintain their structural integrity without any fissures or breaks. Likely cause: robust design and absence of physical stress. For option (E), the panels are not broken; they retain their shape and alignment, showing no signs of fragmentation or displacement. Likely cause: sturdy construction and lack of impact or force. The image shows a clear and uniform surface of solar panels with no visible signs of damage or irregularities. The answer is (C) The defect type is no defect.",
