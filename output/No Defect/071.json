There are no indications of the package being broken as all parts of the packaging are in place and not fragmented. The shape of the package is consistent with an unopened and undamaged product showing no deformation. The packaging appears intact with no visible tears or punctures indicating surface damage. Likely cause: The image shows a properly sealed and undamaged product with no visible defects. The answer is (E) The defect type is no defect.",
