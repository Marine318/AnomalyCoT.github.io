    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)broken(B)dirty(C)no defect(D)crack(E)deformation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "broken",
      "B": "dirty",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "crack",
      "E": "deformation"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:The image shows a ceramic insulator with no visible cracks deformations dirt or breaks on its surface and structure appears intact Likely cause: The insulator has been maintained properly and is in good condition. The answer is (C) The defect type is no defect.",
