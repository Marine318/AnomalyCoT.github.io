    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)disconnected cable(B)no defect(C)tear insulation(D)cut inner insulation(E)cut outer insulation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "disconnected cable",
      "B": "no defect",
      "C": "tear insulation",
      "D": "cut inner insulation",
      "E": "cut outer insulation"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:There are no signs of disconnected cables as all conductors are present and undamaged. There is no tear in the insulation as all layers appear smooth and unbroken. There is no cut in the inner insulation as the conductors are fully enclosed. There is no cut in the outer insulation as the sheath is continuous and unbroken. The image shows a cross-section of a cable with three distinct conductors each encased in intact insulation within an outer sheath. Likely cause: The image depicts a properly sectioned cable with no visible defects. The answer is (B) The defect type is no defect.",
    "Answer": "(B)no defect"
