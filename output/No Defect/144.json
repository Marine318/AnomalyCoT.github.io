For option (B), the straw is present and not missing. For option (C), the cap is not half-open; it is sealed correctly. For option (D), there are no visible signs of surface damage on the carton. The image shows a milk carton with a straw that appears to be properly sealed and intact without any visible signs of damage or defects on the surface of the packaging.
