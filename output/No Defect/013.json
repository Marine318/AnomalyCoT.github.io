    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)corrosion(B)broken(C)no defect(D)deformation(E)dirty.",
    "options": {
      "A": "corrosion",
      "B": "broken",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "deformation",
      "E": "dirty"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Other options, such as corrosion, broken, deformation, or dirt, are not evident in this image. The image shows a ceramic insulator with no visible signs of corrosion broken deformation or dirt. Likely cause: The insulator appears to be in good condition with all parts intact and clean. The answer is (C) The defect type is no defect.",
    "Answer": "(C)no defect"
