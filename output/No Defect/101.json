    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)broken(B)no defect(C)scratch(D)crack(E)miss.",
    "options": {
      "A": "broken",
      "B": "no defect",
      "C": "scratch",
      "D": "crack",
      "E": "miss"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:The image shows a circular object with a pink line running through it against a textured background. There are no visible signs of breaking scratching cracking or missing parts on the object itself. Likely cause: The pink line appears to be an intentional mark rather than a defect given its uniformity and placement. The answer is (B) The defect type is no defect.",
    "Answer": "(B)no defect"
