    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)corrosion(B)dirty(C)no defect(D)broken(E)deformation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "corrosion",
      "B": "dirty",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "broken",
      "E": "deformation"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Likely cause: The insulator appears to be in good condition with no missing features indicative of the other defect types. The image shows a ceramic insulator with no visible signs of corrosion, dirt, breakage, or deformation. The answer is (C) The defect type is no defect.",
    "Answer": "(C)no defect"
