    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)corrosion(B)no defect(C)crack(D)dirty(E)deformation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "corrosion",
      "B": "no defect",
      "C": "crack",
      "D": "dirty",
      "E": "deformation"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:The image shows a ceramic insulator with no visible signs of corrosion crack dirt or deformation. Likely cause: The insulator appears to be in good condition with no observable defects. The answer is (B) The defect type is no defect.",
    "Answer": "(B)no defect"
