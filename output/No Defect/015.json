    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)leakage(B)inclusion(C)blister(D)flattening(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "leakage",
      "B": "inclusion",
      "C": "blister",
      "D": "flattening",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reason for (A): No visible signs of leakage such as liquid pooling or wet spots on capsule surface Likely cause: Proper sealing during production. Rejection reason for (B): Absence of foreign particles or discoloration that would indicate inclusion Likely cause: Clean production environment and material handling. Rejection reason for (C): Capsules do not exhibit raised bumps or deformities characteristic of blisters Likely cause: Controlled drying process preventing air entrapment. Rejection reason for (D): All capsules maintain consistent oval shape without any signs of crushing or warping Likely cause: Adequate handling and packaging avoiding physical damage. All capsules appear uniform in shape size and color with smooth surfaces free of blemishes or irregularities indicating consistent manufacturing process. The answer is (E) The defect type is no defect.",
    "Answer": "(E)no defect"
