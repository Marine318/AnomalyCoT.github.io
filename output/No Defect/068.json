    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)corrosion(B)broken(C)no defect(D)crack(E)deformation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "corrosion",
      "B": "broken",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "crack",
      "E": "deformation"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:The image shows a suspension insulator stack with no visible signs of corrosion broken surfaces cracks or deformation. Likely cause: The structure appears intact with all components in their proper places and no visual anomalies. The answer is (C) The defect type is no defect.",
    "Answer": "(C)no defect"
