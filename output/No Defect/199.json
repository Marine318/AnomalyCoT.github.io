    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)foreign_body(B)scratch(C)broken(D)no defect(E)crack.",
    "options": {
      "A": "foreign_body",
      "B": "scratch",
      "C": "broken",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "crack"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:For option (A), there is no foreign body present as the surface is clean and unobstructed. Likely cause: meticulous maintenance and installation. For option (B), there are no scratches; the surface appears smooth without any linear marks or blemishes. Likely cause: high-quality material and careful handling. For option (C), there is no broken panel; all sections are intact with no signs of fragmentation or damage. Likely cause: robust construction and absence of physical impact. For option (E), there are no cracks; the structure is solid with no visible fissures or splits. Likely cause: sound manufacturing process and structural integrity. The image shows a clear and uniform pattern of solar panels with no visible interruptions or anomalies. The answer is (D) The defect type is no defect.",
