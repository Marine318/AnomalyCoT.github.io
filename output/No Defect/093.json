    "options": {
      "A": "no defect",
      "B": "corrosion",
      "C": "parts mismatch",
      "D": "curve",
      "E": "wear"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Each part appears consistent in design and material with no discoloration pitting or shape irregularities that would indicate defects. The image shows four metal parts with wires attached, and there are no visible signs of corrosion wear mismatch or abnormal curvature. Likely cause: The parts are new or well-maintained showing no signs of usage-related damage or manufacturing flaws. The answer is (A) The defect type is no defect.",
