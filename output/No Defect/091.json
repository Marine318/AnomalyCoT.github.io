    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)squeeze(B)crack(C)pierce(D)abrasion(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "squeeze",
      "B": "crack",
      "C": "pierce",
      "D": "abrasion",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:For (A) squeeze: there are no indentations or deformations indicating pressure. For (B) crack: the surface is smooth without any linear breaks. For (C) pierce: there are no puncture marks or holes. For (D) abrasion: the coating shows no signs of wear or material loss. The capsule appears intact with no visible signs of squeezing cracking piercing or abrasion. Likely cause: the capsule has been handled and stored properly maintaining its integrity. The answer is (E) The defect type is no defect.",
