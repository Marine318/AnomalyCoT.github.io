    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)damaged case(B)misplaced(C)no defect(D)tilted lead(E)deformed case.",
    "options": {
      "A": "damaged case",
      "B": "misplaced",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "tilted lead",
      "E": "deformed case"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:There are no signs of damage or deformation on the case, and the leads are not tilted or misplaced. The image shows a component properly placed on a breadboard with leads correctly inserted into the holes. Likely cause: The component was handled and placed correctly during assembly. The answer is (C) The defect type is no defect.",
    "Answer": "(C)no defect"
