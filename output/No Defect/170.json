    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)deformation(B)broken(C)no defect(D)dirty(E)crack.",
    "options": {
      "A": "deformation",
      "B": "broken",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "dirty",
      "E": "crack"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:The image shows a ceramic insulator on an electrical line with no visible signs of deformation, breaks, dirt, or cracks. Likely cause: the insulator appears to be in good condition with all parts intact and clean. The answer is (C) The defect type is no defect.",
    "Answer": "(C)no defect"
