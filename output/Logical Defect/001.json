    "Question": "Please observe the two images: the first image is the one to be evaluated, and the remaining one is normal reference images. Based on the normal image, determine whether the first image contains any defect.\n(A)Discoloration(B)Excess items(C)Missing items(D)no defect(E)Crack.",
    "options": {
      "A": "Discoloration",
      "B": "Excess items",
      "C": "Missing items",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "Crack"
    },
    "Reasoning": "The answer is (C). The defect type is Missing items.\n\nAnalyzing the differences between the test image and the normal reference images, it is clear that the test image has fewer pushpins in each compartment compared to the normal reference images. This indicates that some pushpins are missing from the test image, which corresponds to the defect type \"Missing items.\"",
