    "Question": "Please observe the two images: the first image is the one to be evaluated, and the remaining one is normal reference images. Based on the normal image, determine whether the first image contains any defect.\n(A)Incorrect bolt length(B)Damaged packaging(C)no defect(D)Discoloration of hardware items(E)Incorrect number of hardware items.",
    "options": {
      "A": "Incorrect bolt length",
      "B": "Damaged packaging",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "Discoloration of hardware items",
      "E": "Incorrect number of hardware items"
    },
    "Reasoning": "The answer is (A). The defect type is Incorrect bolt length.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Both images show a plastic bag containing two bolts, two nuts, and two washers.\n- In the first image (the one to be evaluated), one of the bolts appears to be longer than the other.\n- In the second image (the normal reference image), both bolts are of the same length.\n- The difference in bolt length between the two images indicates that the first image contains a bolt with an incorrect length.",
    "Answer": "(A)Incorrect bolt length",
