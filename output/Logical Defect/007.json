    "Question": "Please observe the two images: the first image is the one to be evaluated, and the remaining one is normal reference images. Based on the normal image, determine whether the first image contains any defect.\n(A)Incorrect size of bolt(B)Incorrect type of hardware(C)Incorrect number of nuts(D)no defect(E)Damage to the plastic bag.",
    "options": {
      "A": "Incorrect size of bolt",
      "B": "Incorrect type of hardware",
      "C": "Incorrect number of nuts",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "Damage to the plastic bag"
    },
    "Reasoning": "The answer is (A). The defect type is Incorrect size of bolt.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Both images show a plastic bag containing two bolts, two hex nuts, and two lock washers.\n- The reference image shows two bolts of the same length.\n- The test image shows one bolt that is longer than the other.\n- This discrepancy indicates that the longer bolt in the test image is not supposed to be there, as all bolts should be of the same length according to the reference image.\n- Therefore, the defect is identified as an incorrect size of the bolt.",
    "Answer": "(A)Incorrect size of bolt",
