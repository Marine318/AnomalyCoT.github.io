    "Question": "Please observe the two images: the first image is the one to be evaluated, and the remaining one is normal reference images. Based on the normal image, determine whether the first image contains any defect. \n(A)Additional pushpin(B)no defect(C)Damaged pushpin(D)Missing pushpin(E)Misaligned pushpin.",

      "C": "Damaged pushpin",
      "D": "Missing pushpin",
      "E": "Misaligned pushpin"
    },
    "Reasoning": "The answer is (A). The defect type is Additional pushpin.\n\nUpon comparing the two images, the first image contains an additional pushpin in the top right corner of the second column from the left. This pushpin is not present in the reference image, indicating that the defect is an additional pushpin.",
