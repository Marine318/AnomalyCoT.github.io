    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)cap half open(B)surface anomaly(C)no defect(D)surface damage(E)opened.",
    "options": {
      "A": "cap half open",
      "B": "surface anomaly",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "surface damage",
      "E": "opened"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) cap half open - cap is fully sealed; (B) surface anomaly - no irregularities other than damage; (C) no defect - damage is present; (E) opened - seal and cap intact. The defect type is surface damage. Anomaly region coordinates [[(1331,2025),(1703,2306)]] indicate a visible scratch or abrasion on the bottle's surface disrupting the label and plastic integrity. Likely cause: mechanical impact during handling or transportation. The answer is (D).",
    "Answer": "(D)surface damage"
