    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)no defect(B)Ground Subsidence(C)crack(D)break(E)Landslide.",
    "options": {
      "A": "no defect",
      "B": "Ground Subsidence",
      "C": "crack",
      "D": "break",
      "E": "Landslide"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Reject (A) as the image shows a clear defect. Reject (B) as there's no evidence of ground level changes or sinking. Reject (D) as the discontinuity isn't wide or deep enough to be classified as a break. Reject (E) as landslides involve mass movement of earth not present here. The defect type is crack because a linear discontinuity is visible across the surface consistent with cracking. Likely cause: Stress on the material exceeding its tensile strength leading to linear failure. The answer is (C) [[(40,548),(991,651)]]",
    "Answer": "(C)crack"
