    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)break(B)Collapse(C)crack(D)no defect(E)Surface Deformation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "break",
      "B": "Collapse",
      "C": "crack",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "Surface Deformation"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Surface deformation is absent due to the lack of warping or displacement around the crack. No signs of breakage or collapse are present as the surface remains intact albeit fractured. The image shows a linear discontinuity with varying width indicative of a crack; the anomaly region coordinates [[(32,172),(1005,896)]] and the defect type is crack. Likely cause: Stress-induced fracture from thermal expansion or contraction. The answer is (C).",
    "Answer": "(C)crack"
