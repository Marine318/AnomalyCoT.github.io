    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)no defect(B)missnut(C)looseness(D)scratch(E)crack.",
    "options": {
      "A": "no defect",
      "B": "missnut",
      "C": "looseness",
      "D": "scratch",
      "E": "crack"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) Incorrect as defects are present (B) Incorrect as all nuts are present (D) Incorrect as there are no scratch marks (E) Incorrect as there are no crack patterns Analysis of entire image shows other bolts tightly secured with no gaps The anomaly region coordinates [[(231,294),(286,359)]] show a bolt that appears less secure compared to others with visible gap between nut and surface indicating looseness Likely cause: Incomplete tightening during assembly process The answer is (C) The defect type is looseness",
    "Answer": "(C)looseness"
