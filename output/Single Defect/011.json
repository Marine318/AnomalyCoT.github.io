      "B": "slice",
      "C": "scratch",
      "D": "screen separation",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) Stain - no discoloration or liquid residue present. (B) Slice - no deep cuts or separation of material observed. (D) Screen separation - no gaps or lifting of the screen layers detected. (E) No defect - clear presence of scratches invalidates this option.

Scratches are visible as linear marks on the surface of the screen disrupting the uniformity Likely cause: Physical contact with a sharp object causing superficial damage to the screen's protective layer. The answer is (C).",
