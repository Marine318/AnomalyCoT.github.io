    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) hole - no visible holes; (C) broken - no broken edges or shattered cells; (D) crack - no linear cracks present; (E) no defect - defects are present as outlined. The defect type is miss. Anomaly region coordinates [[(33,156),(8,195)],[(121,247),(105,282)],[(304,479),(321,511)]] indicate missing solar cells in these areas. Likely cause: manufacturing defect or damage during installation. The answer is (B).",
