    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)scratched outer insulation(B)cut outer insulation(C)cable swap(D)no defect(E)poke insulation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "scratched outer insulation",
      "B": "cut outer insulation",
      "C": "cable swap",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "poke insulation"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) scratched outer insulation - no visible scratches; (C) cable swap - cable colors and positions are consistent; (D) no defect - the cut is evident; (E) poke insulation - no protrusions piercing the insulation. The anomaly region coordinates [[(86,650),(248,797)]] and the defect type is cut outer insulation. The white outer insulation shows a clear cut exposing the inner layers which should be intact. Likely cause: mechanical damage during installation or handling. The answer is (B).",
    "Answer": "(B)cut outer insulation"
