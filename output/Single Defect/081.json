    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)foreign body(B)no defect(C)miss(D)dirt(E)broken.",
    "options": {
      "A": "foreign body",
      "B": "no defect",
      "C": "miss",
      "D": "dirt",
      "E": "broken"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Option (A) foreign body rejected as no external objects are present. Option (B) no defect rejected due to visible anomalies. Option (C) miss rejected as all cells appear accounted for. Option (D) dirt rejected as there's no discoloration or smudging indicative of dirt. The defect type is broken. Anomaly region coordinates [[(462,343),(486,359)],[(29,455),(39,468)],[(51,41),(66,63)]] indicate discontinuities in the solar panel grid lines suggesting cracks or breaks. Likely cause: physical damage from impact or material fatigue. The answer is (E).",
    "Answer": "(E)broken"
