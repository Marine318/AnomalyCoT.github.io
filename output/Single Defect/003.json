    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)Stain(B)Crease(C)Seam Mark(D)no defect(E)Color Deviation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "Stain",
      "B": "Crease",
      "C": "Seam Mark",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "Color Deviation"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:A is rejected due to absence of discoloration C is rejected due to intact design continuity D is rejected as defect is evident E is rejected due to consistent color application across the image. The anomaly region coordinates [[(620,103),(787,126)]] and The defect type is Crease because a linear irregularity disrupts the pattern's symmetry Likely cause: mechanical stress during handling or manufacturing. The answer is (B).",
    "Answer": "(B)Crease"
