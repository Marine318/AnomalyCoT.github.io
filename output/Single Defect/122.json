    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)liquid(B)color(C)scratch(D)no defect(E)crack.",
    "options": {
      "A": "liquid",
      "B": "color",
      "C": "scratch",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "crack"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) liquid - no signs of fluid absorption or distortion; (B) color - uniform coloration without discoloration patches; (D) no defect - clear presence of linear disruptions; (E) crack - cracks typically show separation along the grain, not linear interruptions. Anomaly region coordinates [[(857,3),(478,211)],[(857,236),(725,276)],[(377,295),(190,349)],[(641,651),(542,713)],[(200,781),(50,869)]] indicate linear irregularities disrupting the wood grain pattern consistent with scratching. Likely cause: external object dragged across the surface causing superficial damage. The defect type is scratch. The answer is (C).",
    "Answer": "(C)scratch"
