    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)break(B)crack(C)Collapse(D)no defect(E)Surface Deformation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "break",
      "B": "crack",
      "C": "Collapse",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "Surface Deformation"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Option (A) break rejected as there's no abrupt separation of material. Option (C) collapse rejected due to absence of sunken or depressed areas. Option (D) no defect rejected as the crack is evident. Option (E) Surface Deformation rejected as the surface shows no signs of warping or distortion. The anomaly region coordinates [[(34,625),(334,545)],[(357,560),(1022,710)]] The defect type is crack. A linear discontinuity is visible across the surface indicative of a crack. Likely cause: Stress on the material exceeding its tensile strength leading to cracking. The answer is (B).",
    "Answer": "(B)crack"
