    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)missnut(B)broken(C)crack(D)no defect(E)missbolt.",
    "options": {
      "A": "missnut",
      "B": "broken",
      "C": "crack",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "missbolt"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: Option (B) broken - there are no visible fractures or breaks in the structure. Option (C) crack - no linear discontinuities indicative of cracks are present. Option (D) no defect - the missing nuts clearly indicate a defect. Option (E) missbolt - while bolts are missing, the term 'missnut' is more accurate as it specifies the missing component. The defect type is missnut. Anomaly region coordinates [[(443,205),(499,256)],[(377,281),(425,332)]]. Explanation: There are missing nuts in the specified regions indicating a missnut defect. Likely cause: Incomplete assembly or loss during handling. The answer is (A).",
    "Answer": "(A)missnut"
