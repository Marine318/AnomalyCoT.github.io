    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)break(B)Landslide(C)Surface Deformation(D)crack(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "break",
      "B": "Landslide",
      "C": "Surface Deformation",
      "D": "crack",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Landslide is incorrect as there's no mass movement or displacement of material. Surface deformation isn't present as the surrounding area is flat without warping. No defect is inaccurate due to the visible crack. The anomaly region coordinates [[(999,5),(386,601)],[(380,596),(55,1018)]] The defect type is crack. The image shows a linear discontinuity in the surface indicative of a crack. There's no evidence of a break as the surface remains intact albeit with a fissure. Likely cause: Stress on the material exceeding its tensile strength leading to fracture. The answer is (D).",
    "Answer": "(D)crack"
