    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)miss(B)hole(C)foreign body(D)broken(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "miss",
      "B": "hole",
      "C": "foreign body",
      "D": "broken",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (B) hole - there are no perforations or through-and-through openings; (C) foreign body - no additional objects or materials are present on the surface; (D) broken - the structure of the cells does not show any cracks or fragmentation; (E) no defect - the identified regions clearly lack expected features. Anomaly region coordinates [[(115,29),(134,62)],[(274,199),(291,227)],[(414,269),(437,299)],[(384,393),(399,420)]] indicate missing solar cells which are absent in these areas where they should be present. The defect type is miss. Likely cause: manufacturing defect or damage during installation resulting in missing cells. The answer is (A).",
    "Answer": "(A)miss"
