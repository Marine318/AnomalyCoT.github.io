    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)stain(B)cap open(C)cap half open(D)improper seal(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "stain",
      "B": "cap open",
      "C": "cap half open",
      "D": "improper seal",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "The answer is (C). The anomaly region coordinates [[(1600,416),(2035,573)]] and the defect type is cap half open. The cap is visibly not fully secured on the bottle indicating it is only partially closed. Rejection reasons: (A) stain - no visible stain on the bottle; (B) cap open - the cap is partially on the bottle not completely removed; (D) improper seal - while related, 'cap half open' is more specific and accurate; (E) no defect - the cap's position indicates a defect. Likely cause: accidental or intentional partial removal of the cap leading to its current state.",
    "Answer": "(C)cap half open"
