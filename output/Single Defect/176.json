    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)slice(B)dirty(C)no defect(D)scratch(E)texture.",
    "options": {
      "A": "slice",
      "B": "dirty",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "scratch",
      "E": "texture"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:The linear marks are indicative of scratching as opposed to other defects like slices which would show a different pattern dirty surfaces would have residue texture variations refer to the natural grain. Likely cause: mechanical contact with a sharp object causing superficial damage to the surface. The anomaly region coordinates [(421,491),(592,519)],[(939,474),(1032,502)] and the defect type is scratch. The answer is (D).",
    "Answer": "(D)scratch"
