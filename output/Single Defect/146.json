    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)dirt(B)crack(C)scratch(D)no defect(E)broken.",
    "options": {
      "A": "dirt",
      "B": "crack",
      "C": "scratch",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "broken"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) dirt - no accumulated particles visible; (B) crack - the break is too wide and jagged for a typical crack; (C) scratch - the anomaly is too deep and wide; (D) no defect - the break is evident and significant. The defect type is broken. The anomaly region coordinates [[(235,168),(211,207)]] show a clear break in the continuity of the insulator's structure indicating a fracture. The surface around the break shows irregularities inconsistent with manufacturing marks. Likely cause: mechanical stress or impact leading to structural failure. The answer is (E).",
    "Answer": "(E)broken"
