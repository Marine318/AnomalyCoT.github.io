    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)break(B)Surface Deformation(C)no defect(D)crack(E)Ground Subsidence.",
    "options": {
      "A": "break",
      "B": "Surface Deformation",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "crack",
      "E": "Ground Subsidence"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Reject (A) break as the discontinuity is not jagged or stepped. Reject (B) Surface Deformation as there is no evidence of warping or indentation. Reject (C) no defect as the crack is visible. Reject (E) Ground Subsidence as there is no indication of sinking or displacement around the anomaly. Anomaly region coordinates [[(593,334),(999,172)],[(591,348),(540,662)],[(205,628),(537,689)],[(582,721),(882,863)]]. The image shows a clear linear discontinuity in the surface indicative of a crack. The defect type is crack. Likely cause: Stress on the material exceeding its tensile strength leading to fracture. The answer is (D).",
    "Answer": "(D)crack"
