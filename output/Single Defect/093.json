    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)Surface Deformation(B)break(C)no defect(D)Landslide(E)crack.",
    "options": {
      "A": "Surface Deformation",
      "B": "break",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "Landslide",
      "E": "crack"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:The image shows a clear linear discontinuity in the surface indicative of a crack with no signs of deformation break landslide or absence of defects. The anomaly region coordinates [[(32,19),(983,1018)]] and the defect type is crack. Likely cause: Stress on the material exceeding its tensile strength leading to fracture. The answer is (E).",
    "Answer": "(E)crack"
