    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)screen separation(B)Oil(C)no defect(D)dirty(E)scratch.",
    "options": {
      "A": "screen separation",
      "B": "Oil",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "dirty",
      "E": "scratch"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) screen separation not evident as there are no gaps or misalignments; (C) no defect incorrect as there are visible anomalies; (D) dirty rejected because dirt typically appears as fine particles rather than smooth patches; (E) scratch incorrect as there are no linear marks or grooves present. The anomaly region coordinates [[(450,323),(587,492)],[(610,327),(745,592)]] and the defect type is Oil. The image shows two distinct oily spots with a glossy sheen indicative of oil residue on the surface. Likely cause: accidental contact with skin or another oily substance transferring to the screen. The answer is (B).",
    "Answer": "(B)Oil"
