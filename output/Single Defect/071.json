    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)chip(B)break(C)dent(D)surface damage(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "chip",
      "B": "break",
      "C": "dent",
      "D": "surface damage",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:(A) rejected as there's no small flake or piece broken off; (C) rejected as there's no inward depression of the surface; (D) rejected as the damage exceeds superficial level affecting structure; (E) rejected as obvious damage is present. The defect type is break as the image shows a clear break in the car's structure with visible damage to the door and side panel consistent with a break rather than a chip dent or surface damage Likely cause: collision impact causing structural failure; The answer is (B) The defect type is break [[(85,129),(297,398)]]",
