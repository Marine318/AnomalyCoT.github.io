    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)squeezed teeth(B)fabric border(C)misaligned teeth(D)no defect(E)fabric interior.",
    "options": {
      "A": "squeezed teeth",
      "B": "fabric border",
      "C": "misaligned teeth",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "fabric interior"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Option (B) rejected as there's no fabric border visible; Option (C) rejected because teeth are squeezed not misaligned; Option (D) rejected as there is a visible defect; Option (E) rejected as there's no fabric interior shown. The anomaly region coordinates [[(428,640),(607,854)]] and the defect type is squeezed teeth. Teeth are compressed and not aligned properly causing a visual defect. Likely cause: manufacturing defect during zipping process. The answer is (A).",
    "Answer": "(A)squeezed teeth"
