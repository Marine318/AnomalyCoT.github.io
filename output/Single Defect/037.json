    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)dent(B)chip(C)no defect(D)surface damage(E)break.",
    "options": {
      "A": "dent",
      "B": "chip",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "surface damage",
      "E": "break"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Likely cause: impact from an object causing the material to crack. The headlight shows a clear fracture line indicative of a break rather than a dent chip surface damage or no defect. The anomaly region coordinates [[(171,193),(269,258)]] and the defect type is break. The answer is (E).",
    "Answer": "(E)break"
