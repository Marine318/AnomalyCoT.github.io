    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)stain(B)cap half open(C)no defect(D)cap open(E)bottle cracked.",
    "options": {
      "A": "stain",
      "B": "cap half open",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "cap open",
      "E": "bottle cracked"
    },
    "Reasoning": "The answer is (D). The anomaly region coordinates [[(1566,285),(2048,416)]] and the defect type is cap open. The bottle's cap is visibly open, which is not typical for an unopened beverage bottle. Likely cause: the bottle was opened by a consumer or mishandled during distribution.",
    "Answer": "(D)cap open"
