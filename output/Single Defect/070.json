    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)scratch(B)looseness(C)missnut(D)missbolt(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "scratch",
      "B": "looseness",
      "C": "missnut",
      "D": "missbolt",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:For options (A), (B), and (D), there are no visible scratches looseness or missing bolts in the specified regions. Explanation: The image shows a component with multiple bolt holes but not all have corresponding nuts which should be present for proper assembly. The defect type is missnut with anomaly region coordinates [[(235,86),(266,136)],[(127,131),(152,176)],[(180,214),(205,254)]] indicating missing nuts on the bolts. Likely cause: Incomplete assembly or loss of hardware during handling. The answer is (C).",
    "Answer": "(C)missnut"
