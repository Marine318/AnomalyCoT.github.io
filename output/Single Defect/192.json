    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)deformation(B)crack(C)no defect(D)miss(E)broken.",
    "options": {
      "A": "deformation",
      "B": "crack",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "miss",
      "E": "broken"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:For option (A), deformation is not observed as there are no visible distortions or warping of the cable's shape. Option (B), crack, is incorrect because a crack would imply a split without complete separation which is not evident here. Option (C), no defect, is rejected as the image clearly shows a discontinuity in the cable. Option (D), miss, is not applicable since there is a visible defect and nothing is missing from the view that would suggest an incomplete capture of the object. The defect type is broken. The anomaly region coordinates [[(326,269),(308,307)]] show a clear break in the cable where it should be continuous. This indicates the cable is snapped or severed at that point. Likely cause: The cable may have been subjected to excessive tension or stress leading to its breaking point resulting in the observed breakage. The answer is (E).",
    "Answer": "(E)broken"
