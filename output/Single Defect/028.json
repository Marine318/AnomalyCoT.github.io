    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)scratch(B)crack(C)no defect(D)insect Bore(E)break.",
    "options": {
      "A": "scratch",
      "B": "crack",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "insect Bore",
      "E": "break"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Option (A) scratch rejected due to lack of superficial linear marks; Option (C) no defect rejected as there are visible anomalies; Option (D) insect bore rejected for absence of circular or irregular holes; Option (E) break rejected since there's no separation of material. Anomaly region coordinates [[(63,351),(253,594)],[(244,403),(394,571)],[(48,153),(178,184)],[(25,12),(287,92)]] indicate linear discontinuities consistent with cracking. Likely cause: stress or impact leading to surface fracture. The answer is (B). The defect type is crack.",
    "Answer": "(B)crack"
