    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)miss(B)dirt(C)broken(D)crack(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "miss",
      "B": "dirt",
      "C": "broken",
      "D": "crack",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:The defect is not a miss as all components appear to be present. It is not dirt since there are no visible contaminants or foreign materials on the surface. It is not a crack because the separation is too wide and irregular for a crack. No defect is incorrect as there is a clear anomaly. The image shows a clear break in one of the wires connected to the central component indicating a structural failure. The anomaly region coordinates [[(92,283),(107,315)]] and the defect type is broken. Likely cause: mechanical stress leading to wire breakage. The answer is (C).",
    "Answer": "(C)broken"
