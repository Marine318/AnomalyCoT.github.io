    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)scratch(B)no defect(C)crack(D)broken(E)deformation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "scratch",
      "B": "no defect",
      "C": "crack",
      "D": "broken",
      "E": "deformation"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:This rules out (A) scratch as there are no superficial linear marks; (B) no defect as the structural integrity is compromised; (C) crack as the separation is too wide to be classified as a crack; (E) deformation as the shape alteration is due to a break not a deformation. The anomaly region coordinates [[(167,178),(147,211)]] and the defect type is broken. The image shows a clear discontinuity in the structure of the insulator where it should be intact indicating a breakage. Likely cause: mechanical stress exceeding the material's tensile strength leading to failure. The answer is (D).",
    "Answer": "(D)broken"
