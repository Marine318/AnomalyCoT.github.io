    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)crack(B)no defect(C)Landslide(D)break(E)Surface Deformation.",
    "options": {
      "A": "crack",
      "B": "no defect",
      "C": "Landslide",
      "D": "break",
      "E": "Surface Deformation"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Option (B) no defect is incorrect as there is a visible discontinuity in the surface. Option (C) Landslide is incorrect as there are no signs of mass movement or displacement of material. Option (D) break is incorrect; while similar to a crack, a break implies a more abrupt and possibly wider separation which is not observed here. Option (E) Surface Deformation is incorrect as the surface shows a linear feature typical of a crack rather than a deformation such as buckling or warping. The anomaly region coordinates [[(153,981),(535,440)],[(549,477),(703,998)],[(561,471),(383,22)]] The defect type is crack. A clear linear separation is visible in the asphalt surface indicative of a crack. Likely cause: Stress on the material exceeding its tensile strength leading to a linear fracture. The answer is (A).",
