    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)Collapse(B)no defect(C)break(D)crack(E)Ground Subsidence.",
    "options": {
      "A": "Collapse",
      "B": "no defect",
      "C": "break",
      "D": "crack",
      "E": "Ground Subsidence"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Reject (A) as there's no evidence of material compression or distortion. Reject (B) as the crack is clearly present. Reject (C) as there's no abrupt separation of material. Reject (E) as there's no indication of surface displacement or sinking.  \nThe anomaly region coordinates [[(15,68),(924,997)]] and state \"The defect type is crack\" because a linear discontinuity is visible indicative of a crack. Likely cause: Stress on the material exceeding its tensile strength leading to fracture.  \nThe answer is (D).",
    "Answer": "(D)crack"
