    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)crack(B)no defect(C)dirt(D)deformation(E)broken.",
    "options": {
      "A": "crack",
      "B": "no defect",
      "C": "dirt",
      "D": "deformation",
      "E": "broken"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:The defect is not a crack as there is a complete separation; no defect is incorrect as there is visible damage; dirt is not applicable as there are no visible contaminants; deformation is incorrect as the shape is altered due to breaking not bending or warping. The defect type is broken. The anomaly region coordinates [[(261,261),(277,298)]] show a clear break in the continuity of the insulator's structure indicating a fracture. Likely cause: mechanical stress exceeding the material's tensile strength leading to catastrophic failure. The answer is (E).",
    "Answer": "(E)broken"
