    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)lead bend(B)solder residue(C)miss(D)deposit(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "lead bend",
      "B": "solder residue",
      "C": "miss",
      "D": "deposit",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) Lead bend - no bent leads observed; (C) Miss - all components appear to be in place; (D) Deposit - while there is an excess material it is identified as solder residue not a foreign deposit; (E) No defect - the presence of solder residue indicates a defect. The anomaly region coordinates [[(685,526),(742,571)]] and the defect type is solder residue. Solder residue is visible around the component leads and on the board surface which is not typical for a clean assembly. Likely cause: Excess solder flux was used during the soldering process or inadequate cleaning post-soldering. The answer is (B).",
    "Answer": "(B)solder residue"
