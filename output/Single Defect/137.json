    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)break(B)dent(C)no defect(D)chip(E)surface damage.",
    "options": {
      "A": "break",
      "B": "dent",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "chip",
      "E": "surface damage"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reason for (B): no inward deformation characteristic of a dent is observed. Rejection reason for (C): visible damage precludes 'no defect'. Rejection reason for (D): no sharp irregularities or material loss indicative of a chip are present. Rejection reason for (E): while surface damage is present it is secondary to the break. Anomaly region coordinates [[(76,100),(159,174)],[(172,59),(266,144)]] show a clear separation and misalignment of the rear bumper indicating a break. The defect type is break. Likely cause: impact force exceeding material strength resulting in fracture. The answer is (A).",
    "Answer": "(A)break"
