    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)delamination(B)Oil(C)broken(D)dirty(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "delamination",
      "B": "Oil",
      "C": "broken",
      "D": "dirty",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) delamination is not present as there are no visible layers peeling or separating; (C) broken is incorrect as there are no cracks or shattered areas; (D) dirty is not accurate as the substance appears to be a liquid rather than dirt; (E) no defect is incorrect due to the presence of the oil. The image shows a clear oily substance on the surface of the device which is reflective and has a distinct shape typical of an oil spill. Likely cause: accidental spillage of a liquid with oily properties onto the device's surface. The anomaly region coordinates [[(718,477),(1156,720)]] and the defect type is Oil. The answer is (B).",
    "Answer": "(B)Oil"
