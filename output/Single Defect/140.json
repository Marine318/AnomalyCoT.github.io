    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)dirt(B)no defect(C)broken(D)deformation(E)crack.",
    "options": {
      "A": "dirt",
      "B": "no defect",
      "C": "broken",
      "D": "deformation",
      "E": "crack"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) dirt - no visible accumulation of foreign particles; (B) no defect - evident discontinuity rules this out; (D) deformation - shape remains consistent except at break point; (E) crack - while similar, 'broken' more accurately describes complete separation. Anomaly region coordinates [[(166,197),(181,221)]] indicates a clear break in the continuity of the material at the specified location suggesting structural integrity loss. Likely cause: mechanical stress or impact leading to fracture. The answer is (C). The defect type is broken.",
    "Answer": "(C)broken"
