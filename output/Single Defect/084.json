    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)fracture(B)hole(C)no defect(D)cut(E)crack.",
    "options": {
      "A": "fracture",
      "B": "hole",
      "C": "no defect",
      "D": "cut",
      "E": "crack"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:The defect is not a fracture as it does not show a clean break typical of such an injury nor is it a cut which would have straighter edges. There is clearly a defect so option (C) no defect is incorrect. The image shows a hazelnut with a visible crack running along its surface, which separates parts of the shell. This is indicative of a crack as the edges are irregular and there's a clear separation without any missing material that would suggest a hole or cut. Likely cause: The nut may have been subjected to mechanical stress leading to the shell cracking open. The anomaly region coordinates [[(404,224),(861,743)]] and the defect type is crack. The answer is (E).",
    "Answer": "(E)crack"
