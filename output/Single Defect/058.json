    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)foreign body(B)miss(C)dirt(D)no defect(E)broken.",
    "options": {
      "A": "foreign body",
      "B": "miss",
      "C": "dirt",
      "D": "no defect",
      "E": "broken"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:Rejection reasons: (A) Foreign body - no foreign objects on the panel. (C) Dirt - the panel is clean with no visible dirt. (D) No defect - the missing cells are clear defects. (E) Broken - there are no cracks or broken parts; cells are simply missing. The defect type is miss. Anomaly region coordinates [[(269,183),(245,234)],[(473,426),(434,502)]] indicate missing solar cells. Analysis: The image shows a solar panel with several cells missing in the specified regions which are blank spaces where cells should be present. Likely cause: Manufacturing defect or damage during installation leading to missing cells. The answer is (B).",
    "Answer": "(B)miss"
