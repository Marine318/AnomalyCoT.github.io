    "Question": "Which of the following options correctly identifies the defects in the image?\n(A)surface damage(B)dent(C)break(D)chip(E)no defect.",
    "options": {
      "A": "surface damage",
      "B": "dent",
      "C": "break",
      "D": "chip",
      "E": "no defect"
    },
    "Reasoning": "My analysis based on this image is as follows:A surface damage would show scratches or dents not separation B dent shows inward deformation without separation D chip shows small material loss not large separation E no defect contradicts visible damage The defect type is break as the rear bumper and body panel are torn away from the main structure indicating a break Likely cause: collision impact force exceeded material strength causing separation The answer is (C) The defect type is break [[(137,117),(350,379)],[(284,176),(449,235)]]",
    "Answer": "(C)break"
